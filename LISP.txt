Location identifier Seperation Protocol --> Mapping and encapsulation. mapping done by MS and RLOC routers. encapsulation is done by LISP routers.
EID --> Endpoint IP
RLOC Routing Locator --> connected to which router
Map server --> every RLOC router sends their EID to RLOC mapping
LISP is based on pull model. normal routing protocols are push model.

Map server MS --> has the EID RLOC mapping
Map Resolver MR --> shares this EID RLOC mapping to LISP routers
can be on same or different device. 

LISP Message Type.
Map-register message: LISP Routers to MS to update the EID-RLOC mapping
Map-notify message: MS to LISP Routers, ack of map register message.
map-request message: LISP routers to MR to know about EID-RLOC mapping.
Map-reply message: MR to LISP routers, as a response of map request message.
negative-map reply message: MR to LISP routers, no entry for this EID.

LISp source port random and destination port udp: 4341
ingress tunnel router ITR: encapsulates ip packets
egress tunnel router ETR: de-encapsulates LSIP encapsulated ip packets
Tunel router xTR: bothe ITR and ETR
Proxy router: border router which sites between LISP and non-LISP environment.
Proxy router doesn't send MAP reg message to MS
used as a default router when MS has no mappings for any given subnet.

xTR in SDA becomes FEN
MS/MR becomes the CPN
PxTR becomes the Fabric border node
EID is the ip address of the client
RLOC is the loopback ip of FEN
